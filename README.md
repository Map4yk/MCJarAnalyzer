ðŸ”Œ MCJarAnalyzer - Checking JAR files for Minecraft mods

Why This Tool?
Many Minecraft servers and competitions prohibit mods that provide unfair advantages. Some mods might contain code that:

Modifies hitboxes to make PvP easier
Alters game mechanics in unintended ways
Contains hidden functionality not disclosed by the mod author
MCJarAnalyzer helps server administrators and players verify that mods don't contain potentially problematic code before installation.

Features
