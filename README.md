# MCJarAnalyzer - Minecraft Mod JAR Analysis Tool

üîç A tool for checking Minecraft mod JAR files for potentially unfair advantages

## Why This Tool?

Many Minecraft servers and competitions prohibit mods that provide unfair advantages. Some mods might contain code that:
- Modifies hitboxes to make PvP easier
- Alters game mechanics in unintended ways
- Contains hidden functionality not disclosed by the mod author

MCJarAnalyzer helps server administrators and players verify that mods don't contain potentially problematic code before installation.

## Features

‚úÖ Quick Mod Scanning: Upload and analyze multiple JAR files at once  
‚úÖ Modrinth Verification: Checks if mods are published on Modrinth, a trusted mod repository  
‚ö†Ô∏è Hitbox Modification Detection: Identifies common code patterns used to modify entity hitboxes  
üåê Simple Web Interface: User-friendly design for easy mod verification  
üì¶ Batch Processing: Analyze multiple mods in one go  

## Current Limitations

This is a minimal example project. For production use, consider adding:
- Database integration for caching scan results
- Additional function pattern checks
- Integration with CurseForge API for more comprehensive mod verification
- More sophisticated code analysis (e.g., bytecode inspection)
- User authentication and scan history

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Map4yk/MCJarAnalyzer.git
cd MCJarAnalyzer
